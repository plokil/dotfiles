# My dotfiles

Hi! This is a git repo with my dotfiles. I use the 
[Moonfly colorscheme](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors) from bluz71, huge thanks to 
him for this beautiful colorscheme. 

I wouldn't recommend blindly installing this shit on your system, this is more of a personal repo, not really made for public use. If you are crazy enough to still install it use GNU Stow.

You can use whatever you want however you want and wherever you want, most of this stuff is copy-pasted anyway. Feel free to open up issues if you have any questions.
